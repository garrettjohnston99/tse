# TSE Querier
## Garrett Johnston CS50 20X

To compile, `make`. 

Querier is fully functional, that is:
* Prints set of documents that satisfy a query in decreasing order
* Supports "and", "or" operators with precedence

testing.sh should run on any of the Dartmouth Linux machines, as it copies example data from the cs50 user.
